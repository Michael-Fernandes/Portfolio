	<p class="content-exp">
		I try to be an active advocate for inclusion in tech. To do this I have taught classes, mentored younger students, and done outreach with the Human Centered Design and Engineering department at UW. My trip to Neah Bay in the spring 2017 was one of my proudest moments in this work and something that I hope all people passionate about diversity in the tech community could experience.

	<p class="content-exp">
		A typical college spring break involves a trip to mexico and an all inclusive hotel stay. My final spring break of college was quite the opposite but, much more memorable. UW pipeline attempts to inspire underprivliged K12 students to attend college by connecting them with current University of Washington students. 
	</p><br>


	<p class="content-exp">
		During the winter and spring of 2017, along with a group of 6 other students we built an alternative spring break program to teach design thinking to middle school students. During a stormy late april week we went to the northern point in the continental United States, Neah Bay, to teach the workshops to 100+ middle school students.
	</p><br>

	<p class="content-exp">
		The experience was unbeatable. I felt like I walked away learning as much from the middle schoolers we taught as they learned from us.
