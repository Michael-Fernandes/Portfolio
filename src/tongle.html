			<h2>The problem</h2>
			<div class="flex-wrapper flex-align-center">
				<div class="flex-left">
					<p class="content-exp">
						As automotive technology advances, so does the way we need to think about supporting our transportation infrastructure in general. Specifically, funding for road infrasturcutre is in jeaprody.
					</p>
					<ul class="process-points">
						<li>Funding for road infrasturcutre is decreasing</li>
						<li>The current method, a "tax at the pump" is increasingly inefficent</li>
						<li>Some cars(like fully electric) don't contribute any money to "tax at a pump funding"</li>
						<li>Fuel inefficent cars are forced to contribute an unfair amount</li>
					</ul>

			<h3>Why change?</h3>
			<p class="content-exp">
				<ul class="process-points">
					<li>Charge all road users in porportion to how much they use the roads</li>
					<li>Future proof the way we pay for road infrastructure</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>The Proposed Solution</h3>
			<p class="content-exp">
				A Road Usage Charge(RUC) seeks to fund road infrastructure by charging tax paying citizens in proportion to how much they use Washington state roads. As a capstone team in the Human Centered Design and Engineering department, my team and I were approached by the Washingotn Transportation Comission to come up with a mobile phone application that can be used in a RUC.

			<h2>Why Inclusive Design?</h2>

						Upon getting our assignment for capstone, my team and I were a little bit lost, for a lack of better words. The app suggested clearly was going to run into some problems. It is obvious how this system might help our roads but, most of our classmates had this sense too. A solution for a road usage charge would invade peopleâ€™s privacy, sense of agency and be highly resisted in a state where transportation is a bonding factor. Creating a mobile app solution for the RUC would require including a diverse range of factors and values that people placed on the application.

			<h2>Focusing on Inclusiveness</h2>
			<p class="quote"><b>Users, no matter who they are, are not one dimensional. By designing for inclusivity, designs also account for the multiplicity of all states users might take on.</b></p>
			<p class="content-exp">
				Designing for inclusivity means you design for everybody. For example if you design an Xbox controller for a disabled person with one hand, you also design for a the Mother that is holding her baby while trying to game another, the snowboarder who broke their arm, and a person trying to talk to their mom with one hand and game with another.

			<h2>Choosing Participatory Design</h2>
			<div class="half-img content">
				<img src="img/tongle/process_horizontal.jpg" class="half-width">
			</div>
			<h3> What is pariticpatory Design?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Participatory design puts participants at the center of the design process. </li>
				<li>For a design result to be participatory, the project has to some how increase the agency of the end users of the design</li>
				<li>Design decisions are directed as much as possible by participants</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>How we used participatory design</h3>
			<p class="content-exp">
				<ul>
					<li>Series of 3 co-design workshops with 10 participants</li>
					<li><b>Agile method using a series of design and rearch sprints</b></li>
					<li>Each research and design sprint was a week long</li>

		<h3>Design insights from workshop #1</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>There is a divide between what urban and rural drivers need in a RUC</li>
			<li>There is a preference for keeping the tech in a RUC as low as possible</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>PD insights from workshop #1</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>PD is a great process for identifying edge cases in a design (where a design "breaks")</li>
			<li>Participants are great at ideating but need leadership from designers to do it in a focused manner</li>

			<p class="content-exp">
				I was actually the one to overhear the conversation. At the time, I was mostly just happy that our participants were enjoying the workshop. Later I realized, maybe this was the key. Maybe the solution is not to give one or the other values but to provide ways for different values to come out at different times.

		<h3>Design insights from workshop #2</h3>

			<h2>Saying Goodbye to Participants</h2>
			<p class="content-exp">
				At the end of Workshop #3 we were sad to say goodbye to our participants but, the next part of our journey was just around the corner. During the next two weeks my team and I went through a series of iterations to create Tongle.

		<div class="content">
			<h2>The Final Product</h2>
			<p class="content-exp">
				Tongle is combined solution made up of the ideas first suggested in the RUC court. It gives participants the option of whether they want to track all their mileage on their phone or to buy an external device. It further implements suggestions provided throughout the 3 workshops. This is how each value came to play in the solution

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p class="content-exp">
				After finishing this project and while I presented it during capstone, I always highlighted how powerful a process participatory design can be. After some time has passed I have reflected on what the takeaways for me are. A PD process can be time-consuming and hard to get buy-in from stakeholders. However, I think PD's commitment to the user can and should be emulated. In particular, I think adapting an inclusive design perspective can benefit most design projects by allowing for many different forms or types of the user to benefit from an inclusive perspective.
			</p>
			<p>
				To show how inclusive design uniquely benefitted Tongle, take the following example.
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				By creating a design that allowed those who wanted complete privacy in their location data, Tongle also benefits a range of people. It allows employees to charge their employers on trips taken for company work, it allows a teenager to sneak off to their first concert, or a husband to surprise his wife with a birthday present. By creating an app that allows for flexible use, the user acceptance of the app was increased and thereby a better experience was created overall.
